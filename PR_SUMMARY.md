- **Capabilities:**
  - Track user sign-ins and registrations
  - Track appointment lifecycle (create, update, delete)
  - Track doctor searches with filters and result counts
  - Track doctor profile views and updates
  - Track daily system metrics

### 2. Daily Metrics Background Service

- Sends daily metrics at midnight (00:00 UTC)
- Includes total doctor and patient counts
- Self-healing with automatic retry on failures

### 3. Controller Integration
Analytics tracking added to:
- ✅ `AuthController` - User registration and sign-in
- ✅ `DoctorAppointmentsController` - Appointment create/update/delete
- ✅ `PatientAppointmentController` - Appointment deletion
- ✅ `DoctorsController` - Doctor search and details view
- ✅ `ProfileController` - Profile and picture updates

### 4. Testing
- **New File:** `MedicareApi.Tests/Services/AnalyticsServiceTests.cs`
- 10 comprehensive unit tests
- All tests passing ✅
- Updated all existing controller tests to mock analytics service
- No regression in existing tests

### 5. Documentation
- **New File:** `ANALYTICS.md` - Comprehensive implementation documentation
- Updated `README.md` with analytics features and configuration
- Added Application Insights configuration to `appsettings.json`

## Tracked Events

| Event | Properties | Trigger |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| UserSignIn | UserId, UserType | User logs in |
| UserRegistration | UserId, UserType | New user registers |
| AppointmentCreated | AppointmentId, PatientId, DoctorId | Appointment created |
| AppointmentUpdated | AppointmentId | Appointment updated |
| AppointmentDeleted | AppointmentId | Appointment deleted |
| DoctorSearch | SearchQuery, Specialization, Location, ResultsCount | Doctor search |
| DoctorDetailsViewed | DoctorId | Doctor profile viewed |
| DoctorProfileUpdated | DoctorId | Profile updated |
| DoctorProfilePictureUpdated | DoctorId | Picture updated |
| DailyMetrics | DoctorCount, PatientCount | Daily at 00:00 UTC |

## Configuration Required

Add Azure Application Insights connection string to `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ApplicationInsights": {
    "ConnectionString": "InstrumentationKey=xxxxx;IngestionEndpoint=https://xxxx.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/"
  }
}
```

## Dependencies Added
- `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore` v2.23.0 (Main project)
- `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights` v2.23.0 (Test project)

## Testing Results
- ✅ All analytics service tests passing (10/10)
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ⚠️ Some pre-existing test failures in other controllers (unrelated to analytics changes)

## Benefits
1. **Usage Insights** - Understand how users interact with the system
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Track API performance
3. **User Behavior Analysis** - Analyze search patterns and preferences
4. **System Growth Tracking** - Monitor daily metrics
5. **Data-Driven Decisions** - Use analytics to improve features
6. **Business Intelligence** - Generate usage and growth reports

## How to Test
1. Configure Application Insights connection string in `appsettings.json`
2. Run the application
3. Perform various actions (login, search doctors, create appointments, etc.)
4. View analytics data in Azure Application Insights portal
5. Check daily metrics collection at midnight UTC

## Future Enhancements
- Track appointment completion rates
