# Security Best Practices

## Authentication/Session Management
- Use strong passwords and enforce password complexity.
- Implement multi-factor authentication.
- Ensure session tokens are securely generated and managed.

## PHI Protection
- Encrypt Protected Health Information (PHI) both at rest and in transit.
- Limit access to PHI on a need-to-know basis.
- Regularly audit and monitor access logs for PHI.

## Input Validation/Sanitization
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides.
- Implement a whitelist approach for acceptable input formats.
- Use libraries and frameworks that provide built-in protection against injection attacks.

## Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Use dynamic throttling based on user behavior.
- Monitor for unusual spikes in traffic.

## Developer Guidelines
- Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular code reviews.
- Keep dependencies updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Provide security training for developers.
