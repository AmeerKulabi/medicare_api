## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization** - JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Doctor Management** - Profile management, availability scheduling, and specialization tracking
- **Appointment System** - Complete CRUD operations for medical appointments
- **Patient Portal** - Patient-specific appointment management and profile access
- **File Upload Support** - Profile picture management for healthcare providers
- **Comprehensive Security** - Authorization checks, input validation, and secure data handling
- **Analytics & Monitoring** - Azure Application Insights integration for tracking user activities and system metrics

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmeerKulabi/medicare_api.git
cd medicare_api
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Build the Solution

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project MedicareApi
```

The API will be available at `https://localhost:7001` and `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

The Medicare API includes Azure Application Insights integration for comprehensive analytics and monitoring.

### Tracked Events

The system automatically tracks the following events:
- **User Registration** - When new users sign up (doctors and patients)
- **User Sign-In** - When users log in to the system
- **Appointment Creation** - When new appointments are created
- **Appointment Updates** - When appointments are modified
- **Appointment Deletion** - When appointments are cancelled
- **Doctor Search** - When users search for doctors (includes search query and filters)
- **Doctor Details Viewed** - When users view doctor profiles
- **Doctor Profile Updated** - When doctors update their profiles
- **Doctor Profile Picture Updated** - When doctors update their profile pictures
- **Daily Metrics** - Automated daily collection of doctor and patient counts (sent at 00:00 UTC)

### Configuration

To enable Application Insights, add your connection string to `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ApplicationInsights": {
    "ConnectionString": "InstrumentationKey=your-instrumentation-key-here;IngestionEndpoint=https://your-region.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/"
  }
}
```

You can obtain the connection string from your Azure Application Insights resource in the Azure Portal.

### Analytics Service

The `AnalyticsService` class (`MedicareApi/Services/AnalyticsService.cs`) provides the following methods:
- `TrackSignIn(userId, isDoctor)` - Track user login
- `TrackUserRegistration(userId, isDoctor)` - Track new user registration
- `TrackAppointmentCreated(appointmentId, patientId, doctorId)` - Track appointment creation
- `TrackAppointmentUpdated(appointmentId)` - Track appointment updates
- `TrackAppointmentDeleted(appointmentId)` - Track appointment deletion
- `TrackDoctorSearch(searchQuery, specialization, location, resultsCount)` - Track doctor searches
- `TrackDoctorDetailsViewed(doctorId)` - Track doctor profile views
- `TrackDoctorProfileUpdated(doctorId)` - Track doctor profile updates
- `TrackDoctorProfilePictureUpdated(doctorId)` - Track profile picture updates
- `TrackDailyMetrics(doctorCount, patientCount)` - Track daily system metrics

### Daily Metrics Background Service

The `DailyMetricsService` background service automatically sends daily metrics at midnight (00:00 UTC), including:
- Total number of doctors in the system
- Total number of patients in the system

This service runs continuously and ensures consistent metric tracking for monitoring system growth.

## üß™ Running Tests

This project includes a comprehensive test suite with **88 automated tests** covering all controller endpoints and business logic scenarios.

### Prerequisites for Testing

The test project (`MedicareApi.Tests`) uses:
- **xUnit** - Testing framework
- **Moq** - Mocking framework for dependencies
- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory** - In-memory database for isolated testing
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing** - ASP.NET Core integration testing tools

### Running All Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
dotnet test
```

### Running Tests with Detailed Output

For more detailed test results and logging:

```bash
dotnet test --verbosity detailed
```

### Running Tests with Minimal Output

For a clean, summary view:

```bash
dotnet test --verbosity minimal
```

### Running Specific Test Classes

To run tests for a specific controller:

```bash
# Run only AuthController tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AuthControllerTests"

# Run only DoctorsController tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~DoctorsControllerTests"

# Run only AvailabilityController tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AvailabilityControllerTests"
```

### Running Tests by Category

```bash
# Run only tests with specific naming patterns
dotnet test --filter "Name~ValidInput"
dotnet test --filter "Name~Unauthorized"
dotnet test --filter "Name~NotFound"
```

## üìä Code Coverage

### Generate Code Coverage Reports

To run tests with code coverage analysis:

```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

This generates a coverage report in the `TestResults` directory with detailed line-by-line coverage statistics.

### Understanding Coverage Output

After running coverage, you'll find:
- **Coverage files** in `MedicareApi.Tests/TestResults/[guid]/coverage.cobertura.xml`
- **Coverage percentage** for each project and class
- **Line coverage details** showing which code paths are tested

### Coverage Thresholds

The CI pipeline enforces a minimum coverage threshold:
- **Minimum overall coverage**: 60%
- **Current coverage**: ~78% (varies by controller)

## üêõ Debugging Test Failures

### Common Test Issues

1. **Authentication Context Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check authentication setup in failing tests
   dotnet test --filter "Name~Auth" --verbosity detailed
   ```

2. **Database State Issues**
   ```bash
   # Tests use in-memory database - each test should be isolated
   # Check TestFixture.cs for setup/teardown logic
   ```

3. **Configuration Issues**
   ```bash
   # Some tests may require specific appsettings
   # Check AuthController tests for JWT configuration requirements
   ```

### Test Result Interpretation

- **Passed Tests**: Green checkmarks indicate successful scenarios
- **Failed Tests**: Red X marks with detailed error messages and stack traces
- **Skipped Tests**: Yellow indicators for conditionally skipped tests
