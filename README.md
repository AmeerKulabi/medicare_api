## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for version control)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmeerKulabi/medicare_api.git
cd medicare_api
```

### 2. Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Build the Solution

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project MedicareApi
```

The API will be available at `https://localhost:7001` and `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## 🧪 Running Tests

This project includes a comprehensive test suite with **88 automated tests** covering all controller endpoints and business logic scenarios.

### Prerequisites for Testing

The test project (`MedicareApi.Tests`) uses:
- **xUnit** - Testing framework
- **Moq** - Mocking framework for dependencies
- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory** - In-memory database for isolated testing
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing** - ASP.NET Core integration testing tools

### Running All Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
dotnet test
```

### Running Tests with Detailed Output

For more detailed test results and logging:

```bash
dotnet test --verbosity detailed
```

### Running Tests with Minimal Output

For a clean, summary view:

```bash
dotnet test --verbosity minimal
```

### Running Specific Test Classes

To run tests for a specific controller:

```bash
# Run only AuthController tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AuthControllerTests"

# Run only DoctorsController tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~DoctorsControllerTests"

# Run only AvailabilityController tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AvailabilityControllerTests"
```

### Running Tests by Category

```bash
# Run only tests with specific naming patterns
dotnet test --filter "Name~ValidInput"
dotnet test --filter "Name~Unauthorized"
dotnet test --filter "Name~NotFound"
```

## 📊 Code Coverage

### Generate Code Coverage Reports

To run tests with code coverage analysis:

```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

This generates a coverage report in the `TestResults` directory with detailed line-by-line coverage statistics.

### Understanding Coverage Output

After running coverage, you'll find:
- **Coverage files** in `MedicareApi.Tests/TestResults/[guid]/coverage.cobertura.xml`
- **Coverage percentage** for each project and class
- **Line coverage details** showing which code paths are tested

### Coverage Thresholds

The CI pipeline enforces a minimum coverage threshold:
- **Minimum overall coverage**: 60%
- **Current coverage**: ~78% (varies by controller)

## 🧪 Test Categories

The test suite includes comprehensive coverage across multiple scenarios:

### ✅ Test Types Covered

- **Positive Test Cases** - Valid inputs with expected successful outcomes
- **Negative Test Cases** - Invalid data, missing parameters, malformed requests
- **Authorization Tests** - Unauthorized access attempts, role-based permission checks
- **Validation Tests** - Model validation, business rule enforcement
- **Edge Cases** - Boundary conditions, empty datasets, null value handling
- **Database Integration** - Entity creation, updates, relationships, and data persistence

### 📋 Controllers Tested

| Controller | Test Count | Coverage Focus |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **AuthController** | 15 tests | Registration, login, JWT token validation |
| **DoctorsController** | 12 tests | Doctor profiles, filtering, updates |
| **AvailabilityController** | 15 tests | Schedule management, slot updates |
| **DoctorAppointmentsController** | 15 tests | Appointment CRUD, authorization |
| **PatientAppointmentController** | 16 tests | Patient-specific operations |
| **ProfileController** | 15 tests | Profile management, file uploads |

## 🐛 Debugging Test Failures

### Common Test Issues

1. **Authentication Context Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check authentication setup in failing tests
   dotnet test --filter "Name~Auth" --verbosity detailed
   ```

2. **Database State Issues**
   ```bash
   # Tests use in-memory database - each test should be isolated
   # Check TestFixture.cs for setup/teardown logic
   ```

3. **Configuration Issues**
   ```bash
   # Some tests may require specific appsettings
   # Check AuthController tests for JWT configuration requirements
   ```

### Test Result Interpretation

- **Passed Tests**: Green checkmarks indicate successful scenarios
- **Failed Tests**: Red X marks with detailed error messages and stack traces
- **Skipped Tests**: Yellow indicators for conditionally skipped tests

## 🔧 Build and Test Commands Reference

dotnet run --project MedicareApi

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Run tests without building (after successful build)
dotnet test --no-build

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test project

dotnet test --list-tests
```

## 🚀 Continuous Integration & Deployment

This project includes two GitHub Actions workflows for automated CI/CD:

### 📋 CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Runs automatically** on every push and pull request
- **Executes the full test suite** with detailed reporting
- **Generates code coverage reports** with trend analysis
- **Enforces quality gates** with minimum coverage thresholds
- **Provides test artifacts** for debugging failed test runs

### 🚢 Release Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy_release.yml`)
- **Runs daily at midnight UTC** or can be triggered manually
- **Finds latest successful commit** from main branch
- **Creates/manages release branch** automatically
- **Increments version numbers** in `yy.mm.build_number.0` format
- **Builds, tests, and deploys** to production environment
- **Manages version files** (`build_number.txt`, `version.txt`)

### CI Test Execution

The CI pipeline runs:
```bash
dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```
